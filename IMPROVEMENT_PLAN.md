# Repository Improvement Plan - NFL Lineup Generator

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the NFL Lineup Generator repository. The current codebase is a functional prototype that generates NFL DraftKings lineups through web scraping and basic data processing. However, it lacks many features expected in a production-ready application.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What Works
- Basic web scraping functionality for player data
- Simple lineup generation using random selection
- Integration with DraftKings CSV format
- Core data processing with pandas

### ❌ Critical Issues
- **Dependencies**: Incorrect package names and format in requirements.txt
- **No Testing**: Zero test coverage, making changes risky
- **Poor Error Handling**: Application crashes on network issues or bad data
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: No input validation or sanitization
- **Documentation**: Minimal setup instructions and no API docs
- **No Optimization**: Random lineup selection ignores salary cap and value

### 🔄 Areas for Improvement
- Code organization and modularity
- User interface and experience
- Performance and caching
- Automated development workflows
