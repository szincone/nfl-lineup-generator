# Improve Documentation and Setup Instructions

## Description
The current documentation is minimal and lacks important setup instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. This makes it difficult for new users to get started and for contributors to participate.

## Priority
High

## Labels
- documentation
- good-first-issue
- help-wanted

## Current Issues
1. Missing detailed setup instructions
2. No troubleshooting guide
3. Missing API documentation
4. No contribution guidelines
5. No code examples beyond basic usage
6. Missing dependency explanations
7. No documentation for environment variables

## Tasks
- [ ] Expand README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Create code examples and tutorials
- [ ] Document all environment variables and configuration options
- [ ] Add screenshots and GIFs demonstrating usage
- [ ] Create documentation for different use cases
- [ ] Add FAQ section
- [ ] Set up documentation website (optional)

# NFL DraftKings Lineup Generator

A Python tool for generating optimized NFL DraftKings lineups using web scraping and data analysis.

## Features

- üèà Scrapes player data from Pro Football Reference
- üí∞ Validates salary cap constraints ($50,000)
- üéØ Multiple optimization strategies (value, upside, safe)
- üìä Generates multiple diverse lineups
- üíæ Caching for improved performance
- üñ•Ô∏è Command-line interface
- üìà Advanced filtering and player selection

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/szincone/nfl-lineup-generator.git
   cd nfl-lineup-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` file with your data sources:
   ```bash
   OFFENSE_URL=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/opp.htm
   DEFENSE_URL=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/opp.htm
   CSV_FILE=DKSalaries.csv
   ```

5. Add your DraftKings CSV file to the `csv_files/` directory

### Basic Usage

Generate a single optimized lineup:
```bash
python -m nfl_lineup generate
```

Generate multiple lineups:
```bash
python -m nfl_lineup generate --count 20 --strategy diverse
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OFFENSE_URL` | URL for offensive player stats | `https://www.pro-football-reference.com/...` |
| `DEFENSE_URL` | URL for defensive team stats | `https://www.pro-football-reference.com/...` |
| `CSV_FILE` | DraftKings salary CSV filename | `DKSalaries.csv` |

### DraftKings CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain these columns:
- `Name` - Player name
- `Position` - Player position (QB, RB, WR, TE, DST)
- `Salary` - Player salary
- `AvgPointsPerGame` - Average fantasy points per game
- `Team` - Player's team

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Generate single lineup with value strategy
nfl-lineup generate --strategy value

# Generate 10 lineups with maximum diversity
nfl-lineup generate --count 10 --strategy diverse --max-overlap 4

# Save lineups to CSV
nfl-lineup generate --count 5 --output csv --file my_lineups.csv

# Work with cached data (offline mode)
nfl-lineup generate --use-cache --no-refresh

# Clear cache
nfl-lineup cache clear
```

### Python API

```python
from nfl_lineup import LineupGenerator, DataScraper

# Initialize components
scraper = DataScraper()
generator = LineupGenerator()

# Load and process data
offensive_data = scraper.scrape_offense()
defensive_data = scraper.scrape_defense()
dk_data = scraper.load_draftkings_csv('DKSalaries.csv')

# Generate optimized lineup
lineup = generator.generate_optimal_lineup(
    strategy='value',
    salary_cap=50000
)

print(lineup)
```

## Strategies

### Value Strategy
Maximizes points per dollar spent. Good for cash games.

### Upside Strategy  
Prioritizes high-ceiling players. Good for tournaments.

### Safe Strategy
Prioritizes consistent, low-variance players. Good for cash games.

### Diverse Strategy
Generates multiple lineups with limited player overlap.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'bs4'**
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

**EnvironmentError: Missing required environment variables**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains all required variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**FileNotFoundError: CSV file not found**
- Ensure your DraftKings CSV is in the `csv_files/` directory
- Check that the filename in `.env` matches exactly

**Empty lineup generated**
- Check that your CSV file has the correct format
- Verify that player data was scraped successfully
- Try lowering filtering thresholds in configuration
